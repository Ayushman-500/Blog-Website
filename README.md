# Blog-Website

I learned to build this website in [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course.

- This is a blog website where owner can compose and others can view his/her blogs.
- Data is persisted using MongoDB Atlas.
- Deployed on Heroku - https://intense-reef-23400.herokuapp.com/

How it looks ?
